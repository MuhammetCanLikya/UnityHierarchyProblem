# UnityHierarchyProblem
I can not share Unity hierarchy with my teammates

Unfortunately, Github does not receive the Hierarchy part in Unity. I think it's something to do with the gitignore file.
For example, I just uploaded my game to the repo and then pushed it. There were two game objects, the main camera and the directional light.
Then I reopened the project and added 2 empty objects and named them GameObject and HelloHierarchy. 
I saved and exited the project and saw that there are no changes to push in the github app.
But if I create script file github app detects it and tries to push it.

Because of this problem, when you upload the project, you will not be able to see the objects in the red area in the photo.
